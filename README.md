This is a repo featuring code to create a streamlit app that allows for updates, tracking, and prediction of my bowling performance.

The first tab shows my all time bowling score analysis.

The second tab shows my bowling score analysis on a league by league basis.

The third tab shows my predicted bowling score for the following week.

The fourth tab allows for me to update the data with my scores after I bowl.
